# implementation of corner detection algorithm

• Implement the Harris Corner detection algorithm from scratch.

 • Adjust parameters such as window size and threshold value to optimize
 corner detection performance.
 
 Epipolar geometry analysis involves understanding the relationship between two
 images of a static scene captured from a single camera using the Fundamental
 matrix.
